                Just different approaches. Next.js kind of steers you away from
                server-side rendering, while Exact is all about it.
                Here's a table comparing the two:

                This is a somewhat heavy-weight solution, really intended
                for apps that might get fairly large and that typically run in
                a corporate environment. The app-manager.js is a light layer
                on top of Express, which is itself just a light layer on top of
                the http standard library, so you aren't overly encumbered by
                abstractions. You can do anything you want at the server-side
                level, including in-process TLS, reverse proxying to legacy
                front-end services, and recording access and error logs to disk
                or to some streaming service.

              <p>
                This probably wouldn't be a good choice for most toy apps, or
                for purely client-side developers that don't have experience
                with operations and service ownership.

                Really I made this for myself, to have the superpower of being
                able to spin up React web apps instantly, be it for personal
                projects, or for internal tools at whatever company I happen to
                be working for, or even for high traffic customer-facing
                websites.

              <p>
                You can swap that out with <code>styled-components</code> or whatever you like, it's just
                important to use some kind of CSS-in-JS solution so that everything follows from the
                JS module dependency graph. Keeps your app maintainable in the long run.
              </p>
              <p>
                I personally like <code><a href="https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction">emotion</a></code> because it lets you apply class names to vanilla
                HTML elements. React is all about composition: you build simple components, compose
                those into more complex components, compose those into even more complex components.
                But at the lowest level, down to the metal, you should be able to see and read
                what the HTML is. You should see the DIVs and SPANs. With styled-components for
                example you never do.

            <dd>
              <p>
                Yes but I've been using it in production for over a year and half.
                It's been in alpha for 5 years, I think releasing 5.0.0 is just a formality
                at this point.

              <p>
                If you really think it's important, every time you declare an implementation variable,
                to stop for a moment and think about "will this ever be reassigned or not?" then
                feel free to fork this project as "the ESLint prefer-const edition". <code>"let"</code> reads better
                than <code>"const"</code>, no bugs have ever happened because of inadvertently reassigning
                a variable in ES6, and "const but mutable" is
                pretty pointless.

                This keeps the HTML and JS in sync when you deploy across a
                cluster that's behind a load balancer, and it avoids the need
                for cache invalidation/cache busting. A future version of Exact
                might externalize the react/react-dom part out as a separate
                cacheable script, since it changes infrequently, even thought
                that's somewhat at odds with the design goal of
                "repeatability."
